## Getting started

Open ans issue about challenge you will solve, and I will assign to you with hacktoberfest label.

* Clone your fork down to your local machine

```markdown

```

Create a folder referring to the language that will solve the challenge such as `mkdir swift` ([mkdir its a command line to create a folder](https://guialinux.uniriotec.br/mkdir/)) and inside create the directory with the number and name of the challenge, such as `mkdir 01-Two_Sum` and then `touch 01-Two_Sum.swift` ([touch its a command line to create a file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html)) . If the folder already exists, create only the file referring to the language.

*Please*, copy and paste a readme.md about the question inside your challenge folder *if doesn't exist*, like this example:
